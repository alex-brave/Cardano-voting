    "comment": "The BAT Community DRep Committee has voted ABSTAIN of the Cardano GovTool Budget - 12 months full active maintenance and development, and ABSTAIN for the Tempo for Cardono Governance - Maintenance & Development Budget for 2025.\n\nBoth proposals seek to enhance DRep infrastructure and broaden its accessibility, we believe that the domain of DRep voting should ultimately rest in the capable hands of innovative builders. This vision remains in its nascent stages—for instance, as evidenced by the Lace wallet's ongoing development of integrated infrastructure—yet it demands additional time for other creators to cultivate and refine. Consequently, a difficult choice between victors and contenders as both options support the DRep community. In light of this dilemma, we chose to ABSTAIN as we are in the early midst of DRep and the proliferation of DRep accessibility within the Cardano ecosystem. We love both options and support the outcome chosen by those with conviction."
